# Novel Data Analytic Methods to Improve Burden Estimates for Wasting

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the research and development of multivariate classification models aimed at predicting the burden of child wasting, an acute form of malnutrition. Our work focuses on addressing the challenges in estimating child wasting burden, especially in regions where nutritional survey data is scarce or uncertain.

## Repository Contents
- Data processing: Scripts to prepare and clean the dataset used for model training and testing.
- Model training: Code to train the multivariate classification models on the processed data.
- Unsupervised Clustering Approach: Implementation of an unsupervised clustering method for generating the target variable, crucial for model training in the absence of labeled data.
- Prediction: Tools to apply the trained models to make predictions about the burden of child wasting.
- Analysis: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis of model results and identification of key influencing factors and in-depth data explanation (SHAP analysis).
